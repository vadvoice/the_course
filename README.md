</p>

**Theme:** "Learn React under the sea — guided by SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy!".

This intensive, fast-paced training voyage is **React-focused from day one**. The program runs for approximately **3 weeks** (15 sessions, 2–3 hours each), following an intensive and playful style (SpongeBob energy + developer focus). All work is tracked in a single GitHub repository following professional Git workflows.


## 🏁 Mission & Goals
By the end of this training, every SpongeBob-in-training will achieve the following milestones:
1.  **Understand how to build interactive web apps using React**.
2.  Be comfortable with **modern JavaScript (ES6+)**.
3.  **Complete and deploy a small React app** (“Krusty Krab Dashboard”).
4.  Work like a real developer, utilizing **Git, code reviews, and mini-sprints**.

**The continuous Learning Loop:** Learn → Code → Build → Show → Reflect.

## 🌊 Program Stages

The curriculum is divided into **three main stages** (plus an optional pre-stage), moving from React fundamentals to advanced, deployable applications. All work is tracked in a single GitHub repository.

### 🪸 STAGE 0 — "Vanilla JavaScript Foundation" (Optional Pre-Stage)

[Stage Overview](stages/0/topics.md) · [Task Brief](stages/0/tasks.md)

**Goal:** Build a strong base in modern JavaScript for complete beginners before diving into React.

| Focus Area | Key Concepts | Milestone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vanilla JS Mastery** | HTML & CSS refresher, JS basics, and **ES6+ features** (arrow functions, destructuring, promises). | Functional **"Krusty Krab Orders" app built with vanilla JS**. |
| **Interactivity & Data** | **DOM manipulation & event handling**. Using the **Fetch API + async/await** with TheMealDB. | |

> **Note:** This stage is optional. If you already have JavaScript experience, you can skip directly to Stage 1.

### 🌊 STAGE 1 — "Welcome to Bikini Bottom: React Basics & Environment Setup"

[Stage Overview](stages/1/topics.md) · [Task Brief](stages/1/tasks.md)

**Goal:** Set up a professional development environment and learn React fundamentals from day one.

| Focus Area | Key Concepts | Milestone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Environment Setup** | **NVM, Node.js, VS Code configuration**, **GitHub repository creation**, **Vite + React + TypeScript** project initialization, **Git Flow workflow** setup. | Fully configured development environment with working React + TypeScript project. |
| **React Fundamentals** | **JSX syntax**, **React components** (function components), **TypeScript basics** (interfaces, types), **component composition**, and **project structure**. | **"Interactive Welcome Board"** built with React components, TypeScript types, and proper Git workflow. |

### 🌴 STAGE 2 — "React Lagoon: Components, State, and Data"

[Stage Overview](stages/2/topics.md) · [Task Brief](stages/2/tasks.md)

**Goal:** To understand React fundamentals and build the trainee's first component-based application.

| Focus Area | Key Concepts | Milestone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **React Fundamentals** | **React basics** (what, why, and JSX) with **TypeScript**, **Components, props, and state** with type definitions. | Working **“Krusty Menu Board” React + TypeScript app using state + props + lists**. |
| **Application Building** | Event handling in React with TypeScript, rendering **Lists, keys, and data** sourced from TheMealDB with typed responses, and establishing a simple project structure & styling. | |

### ⚓ STAGE 3 — "Sail to the Surface: Hooks, Routing, and Deployment"

[Stage Overview](stages/3/topics.md) · [Task Brief](stages/3/tasks.md)

**Goal:** To combine all acquired skills into a full, functional mini-app and deploy it live!

| Focus Area | Key Concepts | Milestone (Capstone) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Professional Workflow** | Advanced React Hooks (**`useState`, `useEffect`**) with TypeScript generics, **Component composition & lifting state** with type definitions, and **Routing basics** (React Router) with TypeScript across TheMealDB-powered pages. | **Build and deploy “Krusty Krab Dashboard,”** a mini management app with multiple components, state management, and full TypeScript coverage. |
| **Finalization** | Local storage / API integration with TheMealDB using typed models, mastering **Git workflow** (branching, PRs, review etiquette), and **Deploying TypeScript React apps with Render or Vercel**. | On Demo Day, trainees present their live app and earn the **Golden Spatula of React 🥇**. |
