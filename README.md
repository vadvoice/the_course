**Theme:** “Learn JavaScript and React under the sea — guided by SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy!”.

This intensive, fast-paced training voyage takes trainees through the JavaScript and React seas. The program runs for approximately **3 weeks** (15 sessions, 2–3 hours each), following an intensive and playful style (SpongeBob energy + developer focus).


## 🏁 Mission & Goals
By the end of this training, every SpongeBob-in-training will achieve the following milestones:
1.  **Understand how to build interactive web apps using React**.
2.  Be comfortable with **modern JavaScript (ES6+)**.
3.  **Complete and deploy a small React app** (“Krusty Krab Dashboard”).
4.  Work like a real developer, utilizing **Git, code reviews, and mini-sprints**.

**The continuous Learning Loop:** Learn → Code → Build → Show → Reflect.

## 🌊 Program Stages (The Three Weeks)

The curriculum is divided into three comprehensive stages, moving from foundational JavaScript to advanced, deployable React applications.

### 🪸 WEEK 1 — “Welcome to Bikini Bottom: JavaScript Bootcamp”

| Focus Area | Key Concepts | Milestone (Capstone) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Professional Workflow** | Advanced React Hooks (**`useState`, `useEffect`**), **Component composition & lifting state**, and **Routing basics** (React Router) across TheMealDB-powered pages. | **Build and deploy “Krusty Krab Dashboard,”** a mini management app with multiple components and state management. |
| **Finalization** | Local storage / API integration with TheMealDB, mastering **Git workflow** (branching, PRs, review etiquette), and **Deploying with Render or Vercel**. | On Demo Day, trainees present their live app and earn the **Golden Spatula of React 🥇**. |
