### 🌴 WEEK 2: “React Lagoon: Components, Hooks, and Friendship”

#### I. Goal and Focus
The central objective for Week 2 is for trainees to **understand React fundamentals and build their first component-based app**.

The necessary reference material for this week is the freeCodeCamp React Handbook.

#### II. Key Topics (Lecture/Instructional Material)
The curriculum focuses entirely on introducing and utilizing the primary building blocks of React:

| Topic Category | Specific Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React Basics** | Understanding **what React is, why it is used**, and the syntax of **JSX** (JavaScript XML) with TypeScript. |
| **TypeScript Fundamentals** | **TypeScript basics** for React: interfaces, types, type inference, and component prop typing. |
| **Core Building Blocks** | Deep dive into **Components, props, and state** with TypeScript type definitions, which are foundational to React application architecture. |
| **User Interaction** | Learning the React-specific way of handling **event handling** with proper TypeScript event types. |
| **Data Rendering** | Working with **Lists, keys, and rendering data** dynamically using React principles, including remote data from TheMealDB with typed API responses. |
| **Organization** | Introduction to **Simple project structure & styling** within a React + TypeScript environment. |

#### III. Daily Challenges (Practice/Application)
The daily challenges immediately apply the concepts of components, state, and data rendering to build interactive applications.

| Days | Practice Project | Skill Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 6–7** | **“Bikini Bottom Residents”** | Focusing on rendering React components and utilizing **props** to display dynamic content, such as **SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward profiles**. |
| **Day 8–9** | **“Krusty Menu Board”** | This project utilizes **state and lists** to display menu items fetched from TheMealDB, allow users to **toggle favorites**, and implement logic to **count total Krabby Patties**. |
| **Day 10** | **“Chum Bucket Feedback App”** | Building functionality to **add and remove customer feedback cards**, requiring practical use of component state and list manipulation. |

#### IV. Week 2 Milestone
The successful milestone for Week 2 is the creation of a **working “Krusty Menu Board” React app utilizing state + props + lists**.
