# Week 1 Task Brief — Welcome to Bikini Bottom

## Core Assignment (3-day sprint)
Build the “Krusty Pantry Explorer” web page:
- Pull ingredient data from TheMealDB API by name.
- Render search results with meal thumbnails, ingredient lists, and prep notes.
- Allow users to favorite meals (persisted via `localStorage`) and filter the view between “All” and “Favorites”.
- Ensure the UI is keyboard-accessible and provides loading + error messaging.

## Lab Drill (1-day focus)
- Add the “Make SpongeBob Dance” interaction to reinforce DOM events and animation triggers. Treat this as a separate `lab/` folder so instructors can review fundamentals quickly.

## Stretch Ideas
- Add inline validation + helper text for invalid searches.
- Animate favorites toggling with CSS transitions to reinforce DOM manipulation.

## Deliverables
- Repo structure: `week-1/core/` for the Pantry Explorer, `week-1/lab/` for the animation drill.
- **Git Flow workflow**: All code submitted via feature branches with pull/merge requests to `develop` branch (see [Git Flow guide](../../guides/gitflow-workflow.md)).
- README snippet describing API endpoints used, persistence approach, and accessibility checks.
- Optional: 60-second walkthrough video or GIF demonstrating search + favorite workflow.

## Reference Materials
- MDN guides for DOM APIs, Fetch, Promises, and async/await.
- TheMealDB API docs: `https://www.themealdb.com/api.php`.
- Internal assets: [`gitflow-workflow.md`](../../guides/gitflow-workflow.md), [`mealdb-endpoints.md`](assets/mealdb-endpoints.md), [`favorites-schema.json`](assets/favorites-schema.json).
- Optional: Scrimba or egghead.io clips on modern JavaScript patterns.
