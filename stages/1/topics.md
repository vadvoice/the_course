### 🌊 STAGE 1: "Welcome to Bikini Bottom: React Basics & Environment Setup"

#### I. Goal and Focus
The primary goal for Stage 1 is to **set up a professional development environment** and **introduce React fundamentals** from day one. Trainees will learn to work with React, TypeScript, and modern tooling while building their first React components. All work will be tracked in a single GitHub repository following professional Git workflows.

#### II. Key Topics 
The curriculum focuses on environment setup and React fundamentals:

| Topic Category | Specific Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Environment Setup** | **NVM (Node Version Manager)**, **VS Code configuration**, **Node.js installation**, **GitHub repository creation**, and project initialization with Vite + React + TypeScript. |
| **React Fundamentals** | Understanding **what React is and why we use it**, **JSX syntax**, **React components** (function components), and the **component-based architecture**. |
| **TypeScript Basics** | **TypeScript setup** in React projects, **type definitions** for props, **interfaces**, and **type inference**. |
| **Project Structure** | **Organizing React projects**, **file naming conventions**, **component composition**, and **import/export patterns**. |
| **Development Workflow** | **Git Flow workflow** (feature branches, PRs), **commitlint** setup, and **development server** usage. |

#### III. Daily Challenges (Practice/Application)
Trainees complete daily challenges that build from environment setup to a functional React application:

| Days | Practice Project | Skill Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1** | **Environment Setup & Repository Creation** | Install NVM, Node.js, configure VS Code, create GitHub repo, initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project, set up Git Flow branches (`main`, `develop`), configure commitlint. |
| **Day 2** | **"Hello, Bikini Bottom!"** | Create first React component, understand JSX syntax, render static content, practice component composition with simple greeting cards for SpongeBob characters. |
| **Day 3** | **"Bikini Bottom Residents"** | Build reusable components with **props**, introduce **TypeScript interfaces** for component props, render lists of characters (SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward) with proper typing. |
| **Day 4** | **"Krusty Krab Menu Preview"** | Practice **component structure** and **composition**, create nested components (Menu → MenuItem), work with **static data** and **conditional rendering**, introduce basic **styling** (CSS Modules or Tailwind). |
| **Day 5** | **"Interactive Welcome Board"** | Combine all concepts: multiple components, props, TypeScript types, basic interactivity (click handlers), and proper project organization. Build a small interactive board that displays character information. |

#### IV. Stage 1 Milestone
The successful completion of Stage 1 is marked by:
- ✅ **Fully configured development environment** (NVM, Node.js, VS Code, GitHub repo)
- ✅ **Working React + TypeScript project** initialized with Vite
- ✅ **Functional "Interactive Welcome Board"** built with React components, TypeScript types, and proper project structure
- ✅ **Git Flow workflow** established with feature branches and at least one merged PR
