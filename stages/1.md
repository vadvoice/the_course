### 🪸 WEEK 1: "Welcome to Bikini Bottom: JavaScript Bootcamp"

#### I. Goal and Focus
The primary goal for trainees during Week 1 is to **build a strong base in modern JavaScript** and become comfortable working with the Document Object Model (DOM). This sets the stage for eventually building interactive web apps using React.

#### II. Key Topics 
The curriculum dives into several key areas of web development and JavaScript features:

| Topic Category | Specific Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Aesthetics Refresher** | **HTML & CSS refresher** (referred to as Sandy’s bubble dome aesthetics 🧠). |
| **JavaScript Basics** | Variables, arrays, loops, and objects. |
| **Modern JS Features (ES6+)** | **Arrow functions**, **destructuring**, modules, and promises. |
| **Interactivity** | **DOM manipulation** and event handling. |
| **Data Handling** | **Fetch API** and using `async`/`await` against a live endpoint. |

#### III. Daily Challenges (Practice/Application)
Trainees complete daily challenges that apply the lecture concepts, leading up to a functional application.

| Days | Practice Project | Skill Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1–2** | **“Make SpongeBob dance”** | Using DOM event listeners to animate an image. |
| **Day 3–4** | **“Krusty Ingredient Explorer”** | Consuming TheMealDB API to display ingredient data for Krabby Patty experiments. |
| **Day 5** | **“Krusty Krab Orders”** | Building an interactive order list app that allows users to add, remove, and filter items. |

#### IV. Week 1 Milestone
The successful completion of Week 1 is marked by the milestone of having a **functional “Krusty Krab Orders” app built entirely with vanilla JS**.
