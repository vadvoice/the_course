### 🌴 STAGE 2: "React Lagoon: State, Styling, and Advanced Components"

#### I. Goal and Focus
Stage 2 builds upon Stage 1 fundamentals by diving deeper into React's core concepts and modern development practices. Trainees will learn state management, styling techniques, routing, and debugging tools while building more complex, interactive applications.

#### II. Key Topics (Lecture/Instructional Material)
The curriculum focuses on intermediate React concepts and professional development practices:

| Topic Category | Specific Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **State Management** | Deep dive into **`useState` hook**, state updates, state lifting, and managing component state with TypeScript. Understanding when and how to lift state up in the component tree. |
| **Virtual DOM** | Understanding **how React's Virtual DOM works**, reconciliation process, keys and re-rendering optimization. Learning why React is fast and how to write efficient components. |
| **React DevTools** | Installing and using **React Developer Tools** browser extension for debugging components, inspecting props/state, profiling performance, and understanding component hierarchy. |
| **Props Deep Dive** | Advanced **props patterns**: prop drilling, default props, prop validation with TypeScript, children prop, render props pattern, and when to use composition over props. |
| **Styling & Layout** | **SCSS/SASS** setup and usage, **Flexbox** for layout, **CSS Grid** basics, element positioning (relative, absolute, fixed, sticky), responsive design patterns, and CSS Modules with TypeScript. |
| **Array Operations** | Working with arrays in React: **map, filter, reduce, find, some, every**, array state updates, immutable patterns, and TypeScript array typing. Building dynamic lists with proper keys. |
| **React Router** | **Client-side routing** with React Router v6, route configuration, navigation (Link, NavLink, useNavigate), route parameters, query strings, and TypeScript route typing. |
| **Context API** | Understanding **React Context** for global state, creating and consuming context, context providers, avoiding prop drilling, and TypeScript context patterns. |
| **Zustand State Management** | Introduction to **Zustand** as a lightweight state management solution, creating stores, actions, selectors, TypeScript integration, and when to use Zustand vs Context. |
| **UI Libraries & Tailwind** | Introduction to **Tailwind CSS** utility-first styling, component libraries (optional: shadcn/ui, Radix UI), design systems, and building reusable styled components. |

#### III. Daily Challenges (Practice/Application)
Trainees build progressively complex applications applying all Stage 2 concepts:

| Days | Practice Project | Skill Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 6** | **"Stateful SpongeBob Counter"** | Practice `useState` with multiple state variables, state updates, and TypeScript state typing. Build interactive counters and toggles. |
| **Day 7** | **"Krusty Menu Board with Filters"** | Implement array operations (filter, map) to create a searchable, filterable menu board. Practice state management for filters and search queries. Use React DevTools to debug state changes. |
| **Day 8** | **"Styled Bikini Bottom Layout"** | Build responsive layouts using SCSS, Flexbox, and CSS Grid. Create styled components with proper positioning. Practice component composition with styled children. |
| **Day 9** | **"Multi-Page Krusty Krab App"** | Implement React Router with multiple pages (Home, Menu, About). Practice navigation, route parameters, and shared layouts. Use Context API for theme or user preferences. |
| **Day 10** | **"Favorites Manager with Zustand"** | Build a favorites system using Zustand for global state. Practice creating stores, actions, and selectors. Compare Zustand with Context API patterns. |

#### IV. Stage 2 Milestone
The successful completion of Stage 2 is marked by:
- ✅ **"Krusty Menu Board"** app with:
  - State management using `useState` and Zustand
  - Filtering and searching using array operations
  - Multi-page navigation with React Router
  - Styled with SCSS and Tailwind CSS
  - Proper TypeScript typing throughout
  - Debugged using React DevTools
- ✅ Understanding of Virtual DOM and React's rendering process
- ✅ Ability to choose between Context API and Zustand for state management
- ✅ Professional styling and layout skills
