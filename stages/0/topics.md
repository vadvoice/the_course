### 🪸 STAGE 0: "Vanilla JavaScript Foundation" (Optional Pre-Stage)

#### I. Goal and Focus
This is an **optional pre-stage** for trainees who need to build a strong base in modern JavaScript before diving into React. The primary goal is to become comfortable working with the Document Object Model (DOM) and modern JavaScript features. This stage is recommended for complete beginners but can be skipped if you already have JavaScript experience.

#### II. Key Topics 
The curriculum dives into several key areas of web development and JavaScript features:

| Topic Category | Specific Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Aesthetics Refresher** | **HTML & CSS refresher** (referred to as Sandy’s bubble dome aesthetics 🧠). |
| **JavaScript Basics** | Variables, arrays, loops, and objects. |
| **Modern JS Features (ES6+)** | **Arrow functions**, **destructuring**, modules, and promises. |
| **Interactivity** | **DOM manipulation** and event handling. |
| **Data Handling** | **Fetch API** and using `async`/`await` against a live endpoint. |

#### III. Daily Challenges (Practice/Application)
Trainees complete daily challenges that apply the lecture concepts, leading up to a functional application.

| Days | Practice Project | Skill Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1–2** | **“Make SpongeBob dance”** | Using DOM event listeners to animate an image. |
| **Day 3–4** | **“Krusty Ingredient Explorer”** | Consuming TheMealDB API to display ingredient data for Krabby Patty experiments. |
| **Day 5** | **“Krusty Krab Orders”** | Building an interactive order list app that allows users to add, remove, and filter items. |

#### IV. Stage 0 Milestone
The successful completion of Stage 0 is marked by the milestone of having a **functional "Krusty Krab Orders" app built entirely with vanilla JS**. After completing this stage, you'll be ready to move on to Stage 1 where we start building with React.
