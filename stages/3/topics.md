### ⚓ WEEK 3: “Sail to the Surface: Hooks, Routing, and Deployment”

#### I. Goal and Focus
The ultimate goal of Week 3 is to **combine all skills into a full, functional mini-app and deploy it live!**.

By the end of the program, every SpongeBob-in-training will complete and deploy a small React app ("Krusty Krab Dashboard"), and understand how to build interactive web apps using React.

#### II. Key Topics (Lecture/Instructional Material)
The curriculum introduces crucial concepts for professional React development and application finalization:

| Topic Category | Specific Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Advanced React Hooks** | Focus on practical use of key built-in hooks: **`useState`** and **`useEffect`** with TypeScript generics and type inference. |
| **TypeScript Advanced Patterns** | **Utility types**, **generic components**, and **type-safe API integration** patterns. |
| **Component Architecture** | Techniques for **Component composition** and managing data flow via **lifting state** with TypeScript interfaces. |
| **Navigation** | **Routing basics** using React Router with TypeScript route typing to create multi-page functionality within the single-page application. |
| **Data Persistence** | Methods for integrating data, including **Local storage / API integration** via TheMealDB with typed response models. |
| **Developer Workflow** | Mastering the professional **Git workflow**, including **branching, PRs (Pull Requests), and review etiquette**. |
| **Finalization** | The process of **Deploying TypeScript React apps with Render or Vercel**. |

#### III. Daily Challenges (Practice/Application)
The final days are dedicated to building out the capstone project piece by piece, integrating all knowledge gained throughout the three weeks.

| Days | Practice Project | Skill Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 11–12** | **“Krusty Tasks Tracker”** | Utilizing the `useState` hook to effectively **manage SpongeBob’s chores** (likely involving adding, editing, and deleting tasks). |
| **Day 13–14** | **“Underwater Dashboard”** | Implementing routing concepts, adding multi-page functionality (Home, Tasks, Menu) that share state sourced from TheMealDB. |
| **Day 15** | **Deploy & present!** | The final day is reserved for preparing the application for the public and presenting the finished work. |

#### IV. Final Capstone & Milestone
The culmination of the entire program is the **Final Capstone** project:

*   **Project Name:** **“Krusty Krab Dashboard”**.
*   **Description:** A mini management app featuring **multiple components, state management, and a fun underwater UI**.
*   **Milestone:** The application must be successfully **built and deployed** live.

The program concludes with a **Demo Day**, where **each trainee presents their live app** and earns the **Golden Spatula of React 🥇**.
