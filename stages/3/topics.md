### ⚓ STAGE 3: "Sail to the Surface: Advanced Hooks, Patterns, and Deployment"

#### I. Goal and Focus
Stage 3 focuses on advanced React patterns, professional development practices, and deploying a production-ready application. Trainees will master hooks, implement complex state management, optimize performance, and deploy their capstone project.

#### II. Key Topics (Lecture/Instructional Material)
The curriculum covers advanced React concepts and production-ready development:

| Topic Category | Specific Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Advanced Hooks** | Deep dive into **`useEffect`** hook: dependencies, cleanup functions, side effects, API calls, subscriptions. **Custom hooks** for reusable logic, hook composition, and TypeScript custom hook patterns. |
| **Advanced State Management** | **Zustand advanced patterns**: middleware, persistence, devtools integration, async actions, computed values. **Context API patterns**: multiple contexts, context composition, performance optimization. Choosing the right state management solution. |
| **Advanced Routing** | **Nested routes** and route layouts, **protected routes** and authentication guards, **route loaders** and data fetching, **error boundaries** for routes, **programmatic navigation**, and **route-based code splitting**. |
| **Performance Optimization** | **React.memo**, **useMemo**, **useCallback** hooks, code splitting with React.lazy, bundle optimization, identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks, React DevTools Profiler. |
| **Data Fetching Patterns** | **API integration** with proper error handling, loading states, caching strategies, **React Query** or SWR introduction (optional), handling race conditions, optimistic updates. |
| **Form Handling** | **React Hook Form** integration with TypeScript, form validation, error handling, controlled vs uncontrolled components, form state management. |
| **Testing Basics** | Introduction to **Jest** and **React Testing Library**, writing component tests, testing user interactions, mocking API calls, testing hooks, and test-driven development basics. |
| **Error Handling** | **Error boundaries** in React, error handling patterns, user-friendly error messages, error logging, and recovery strategies. |
| **Deployment** | **Build optimization** for production, environment variables, **Vercel** and **Render** deployment, CI/CD basics, performance monitoring, and production debugging. |
| **Professional Patterns** | **Component composition** patterns, **render props**, **higher-order components** (HOCs), **compound components**, and when to use each pattern. |

#### III. Daily Challenges (Practice/Application)
Trainees build the capstone project integrating all advanced concepts:

| Days | Practice Project | Skill Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 11** | **"Krusty Tasks Tracker"** | Implement task management using `useState` and `useEffect` for persistence. Practice custom hooks for localStorage. Build forms with React Hook Form. |
| **Day 12** | **"Advanced Menu Module"** | Create menu module with API integration, loading states, error handling, and caching. Use `useEffect` for data fetching and cleanup. Implement optimistic updates. |
| **Day 13** | **"Dashboard with Routing"** | Build multi-page dashboard with nested routes, protected routes, and route-based code splitting. Implement error boundaries. Practice advanced routing patterns. |
| **Day 14** | **"Performance & Polish"** | Optimize application performance using React.memo, useMemo, useCallback. Add code splitting. Profile with React DevTools. Write basic tests for critical components. |
| **Day 15** | **"Deploy & Present"** | Prepare application for production: build optimization, environment setup, deploy to Vercel/Render. Create deployment documentation. Present the final project. |

#### IV. Final Capstone & Milestone
The culmination of the entire program is the **Final Capstone** project:

**Project Name:** **"Krusty Krab Dashboard"**

**Description:** A production-ready management dashboard featuring:
- Multi-page experience with advanced routing
- Task management with persistence
- Menu module with API integration
- Global state management with Zustand
- Form handling with React Hook Form
- Performance optimizations
- Error boundaries and error handling
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Deployed to production

**Milestone:** The application must be:
- ✅ Fully functional with all features implemented
- ✅ Performance optimized
- ✅ Tested (at least basic test coverage)
- ✅ **Successfully deployed** to Vercel or Render
- ✅ Documented with README and deployment guide

The program concludes with a **Demo Day**, where **each trainee presents their live app** and earns the **Golden Spatula of React 🥇**.
