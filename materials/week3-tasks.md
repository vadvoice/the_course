# Week 3 Task Brief — Sail to the Surface

## Daily Objectives
- **Day 11–12**: Create the “Krusty Tasks Tracker”. Apply `useState` for task management, introduce derived state (completed counts), and sync data to `localStorage` or a mock API.
- **Day 13–14**: Expand into the “Underwater Dashboard”. Add routing with React Router, compose pages (Home, Tasks, Menu), and orchestrate shared state via context or prop drilling, pulling menu data live from TheMealDB API.
- **Day 15**: Finalize, deploy, and present the “Krusty Krab Dashboard”. Polish UI/UX, run through QA smoke tests, and deploy to Render or Vercel with environment notes, ensuring API calls handle loading and error states gracefully.

## Stretch Ideas
- Layer in `useEffect` for API polling or side effects (e.g., toast notifications).
- Add a lightweight auth gate (mock login) to demonstrate guarded routes.

## Deliverables
- Production-ready React app under `week-3/` with a documented deploy URL.
- README section detailing architecture decisions, routing map, and deployment steps.
- Demo script outlining problem statement, solution tour, and retrospective insights.

## Reference Materials
- React docs on hooks, effects, and context.
- Vercel/Render deployment guides for React + Vite or Create React App setups.
- TheMealDB API docs: `https://www.themealdb.com/api.php`.
