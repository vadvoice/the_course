# Week 2 Task Brief — React Lagoon

## Daily Objectives
- **Day 6–7**: Build the “Bikini Bottom Residents” gallery. Model resident data as JSON, render cards with props, and practice prop-types or TypeScript interfaces for component contracts.
- **Day 8–9**: Deliver the “Krusty Menu Board”. Fetch menu data from TheMealDB API, manage menu state (favorites, counts), lift shared state when needed, and demonstrate list rendering with stable keys.
- **Day 10**: Implement the “Chum Bucket Feedback App”. Support adding, editing, and deleting feedback, reuse components (forms, cards), and confirm state updates via React DevTools.

## Stretch Ideas
- Introduce basic routing with React Router to separate gallery, menu, and feedback views.
- Add testing for one component using React Testing Library to validate props/state handling.

## Deliverables
- A React project inside `week-2/` demonstrating all three feature branches merged into `main`.
- Short Loom (≤3 min) covering component structure, state flow, and key takeaways.
- Notes on questions that surfaced around hooks, props, and data flow.

## Reference Materials
- freeCodeCamp React Handbook (core reading for the week).
- React docs: `https://react.dev/learn` sections on components, props, state, and lists.
- TheMealDB API docs: `https://www.themealdb.com/api.php`.
