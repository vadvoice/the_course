# Week 1 Task Brief — Welcome to Bikini Bottom

## Daily Objectives
- **Day 1–2**: Recreate the “Make SpongeBob Dance” interaction using vanilla JavaScript, focusing on DOM selection, event listeners, and basic animations (CSS classes or inline styles).
- **Day 3–4**: Build the “Krusty Ingredient Explorer” widget. Fetch ingredient data from TheMealDB API, handle loading/error states, and render meal or ingredient details inside a styled card.
- **Day 5**: Ship the “Krusty Krab Orders” app. Support adding, removing, and filtering orders, persist data in `localStorage`, and keep the UI accessible (keyboard + focus states).

## Stretch Ideas
- Add form validation with friendly error messages for the order form.
- Animate list changes (enter/exit) with CSS transitions to reinforce DOM manipulation.

## Deliverables
- Code for all three projects in a single repo under a `week-1/` folder.
- A short video or GIF demo (≤2 min) showcasing each interaction.
- A retro note capturing what felt smooth vs. spiky for JavaScript fundamentals.

## Reference Materials
- MDN guides for DOM APIs, Fetch, Promises, and async/await.
- TheMealDB API docs: `https://www.themealdb.com/api.php`.
- Optional: Scrimba or egghead.io clips on modern JavaScript patterns.
